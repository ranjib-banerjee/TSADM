# TSADM
A repository for everything about my new course "Time Series Analysis and Dynamic Modeling". This course is part of the minor degree in Computational Mathematics, which is offered to 2nd year students. It aims to develop a hand-on learning of the basic concepts of time series analysis and its applications using R programming.
